# SOMPAK for Ruby

A ruby binding to the SOMPAK toolkit. A work in progress. C-code related to
map initialization and SOM have ruby bindings. Classification is based on
pure ruby code.

## Testing SOMPAK_4R

  1. Create the ruby binding
      +  cd sompak_4r
      +  ruby extconf.rb
      +  make
      +  cp sompak4r.so ../som/lib
      +  cd ..
      +  ruby test_som.rb
